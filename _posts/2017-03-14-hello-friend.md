I was pessimistic about blogging at first. I thought it was a waste of time. Time I could spend on writing code, reading a book, play a video-game, etc. Then something changed my mind.

I've been a developer for a few years. Throughout that time, I started to notice something. The more experienced you become, the lower your level of consciousness gets. You become creatively stuck. It easy to be consumer, but it's much harder to be a producer.

Writing is a great way to getting unstuck. It allows you to get through the feelings, situations in a way you otherwise could not. Make room for the new ideas. But, one thing is to come up with ideas, another thing is to make this bundle of ideas undestandable to others. Feedback is required to make this a win-win situation.

This is my story of self-improvement. I will use this blog for sharing:
- Software development ideas
- My challenges
- Views on qualities of a good developer
- Other stuff

So... Nice to meet to you, and let's see how this works out. ðŸ¤—
